simple-wpfaq
============

Just a simple WordPress FAQ custom post type. I've used it on so many sites that it just made sense to finally put it someplace central.

## How to use
1. Activate it.

## Notes
- Treat each "post" as a FAQ. Title = Question. Content = Answer.
- Each FAQ should only have one FAQ because thats how they get grouped. I'm not sure what would happen if you had multiple categoires. So give it a shot and let me know.

## Examples
See `examples/simple.php` for an example loop to include in your theme.
